What is React and its Purpose?
- React is a Javascript Library
- React's purpose is to show content(HTML) to users and handle user interaction.

Why not Redux ?
- React can work by itself
- It can also work with a tremendous variety of other libraries, packages, servers, and databases

A Javascript "class"
React 'components' are made using either Javascript functions or classes

JSX 
- a special dialect of JS which tells a react component how it should it look like when its renderred and shows up on the screen og the browser.
- It looks like HTML and can be placed in JS code. Determines the content of a React app just like normal HTML.

Event Handlers
- event handlers are used to detect user interaction and respond to it

React and ReactDOM
- React is split into two separate libraries
- "React" knows what a component is and how to make components work together.
- "ReactDOM" knows how to take a component and make it show up in the DOM.
